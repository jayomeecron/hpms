                <h2>Welcome to Global Hospital!</h2>
                <p><strong>These Terms and Conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of Global Hospital's services and facilities. By using our services, you agree to abide by these terms.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="mt-4">1. Introduction</h4>
                <p>Global Hospital provides high-quality healthcare services, including emergency care, medical consultations, inpatient and outpatient services, and specialized treatments. By accessing and using our services, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions.</p>

                <h4>2. Patient Rights and Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>Patients have the right to receive treatment based on their needs, including access to medical records and the ability to file complaints. Patients are responsible for providing accurate information regarding their health status and adhering to hospital guidelines during their treatment.</p>

                <h4>3. Medical Treatment</h4>
                <p>Our medical professionals will ensure that all treatments are in the best interest of the patient. All medical decisions will be based on the patient's condition and healthcare needs. In cases of emergency, the hospital reserves the right to perform necessary medical procedures.</p>

                <h4>4. Confidentiality and Privacy</h4>
                <p>Your personal and medical information is treated with the highest degree of confidentiality. We adhere to all privacy laws and regulations regarding patient data and will not disclose your information without your consent unless required by law.</p>

                <h4>5. Appointment Scheduling and Cancellations</h4>
                <p>Appointments must be scheduled in advance through our online system or by calling the hospital's customer service. Cancellations must be made at least 24 hours before the scheduled appointment to avoid a cancellation fee.</p>

                <h4>6. Hospital Code of Conduct</h4>
                <p>We expect all patients, visitors, and staff members to behave respectfully and professionally. Disruptive behavior, including verbal or physical abuse, will not be tolerated. Any violation of the hospital code of conduct may result in immediate termination of services.</p>

                <h4>7. Billing and Payment Policies</h4>
                <p>All services provided by Global Hospital are billed according to our standard rates. Patients are responsible for ensuring timely payment of their medical bills. Payments can be made via cash, credit card, or insurance. If you are unable to pay the full amount, please contact our billing department to discuss payment options.</p>

                <h4>8. Emergency Medical Care</h4>
                <p>In case of an emergency, the hospital will provide immediate medical treatment regardless of the patientâ€™s ability to pay. However, all emergency services will be billed accordingly. Emergency care should be used only for critical health situations, as unnecessary visits may delay care for those in more urgent need.</p>

                <h4>9. Liability and Limitations</h4>
                <p>While we take every precaution to ensure the safety and well-being of our patients, Global Hospital cannot be held liable for unforeseen medical complications, side effects of treatment, or any outcomes resulting from patient non-compliance.</p>

                <h4>10. Amendments to Terms</h4>
                <p>Global Hospital reserves the right to update or modify these terms and conditions at any time. All changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review these terms periodically to stay informed of any updates.</p>

                <h4>11. Contact Information</h4>
